## Overview

This deployment solution offers:

- **Simple Setup**: A single script handles all deployment types
- **Multiple Options**: Support for local, S3 backup, HTTPS with Traefik, and Production-ready deployment
- **User-Friendly**: Interactive setup with clear prompts
- **Secure**: Automatic generation of strong credentials
- **Flexible**: Customizable through environment variables
- **Monitoring**: Optional Prometheus and Grafana integration for production deployments

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

1. **Docker**: Container management tool
2. **docker-compose**: Tool for defining and running multi-container applications with Docker

To install these prerequisites on most Linux distributions:

```bash
# Update your system
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade -y

# Install Docker
sudo apt-get install -y docker.io

# Install docker-compose
sudo apt-get install -y docker-compose
```

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/n8n-deployment-docker.git
cd n8n-deployment-docker
chmod +x setup.sh
```

### Step 2: Run the Setup Script

For interactive setup with prompts:

```bash
sudo ./setup.sh
```

This will guide you through the setup process with a user-friendly menu system.

## Deployment Options

### Local Deployment (Simplest)

This option runs n8n with local storage and backups:

```bash
sudo ./setup.sh --type local
```

### S3 Backup Deployment

This option adds automatic backups to Amazon S3:

```bash
sudo ./setup.sh --type s3 --s3-bucket your-bucket-name --aws-key YOUR_KEY --aws-secret YOUR_SECRET
```

### HTTPS with Traefik Deployment

This option adds HTTPS support with automatic SSL certificates:

```bash
sudo ./setup.sh --type traefik --domain n8n.yourdomain.com --email your@email.com
```

### Production Deployment (Recommended for Public Instances)

This option combines HTTPS support with S3 backups for a complete production-ready solution:

```bash
sudo ./setup.sh --type production --domain n8n.yourdomain.com --email your@email.com --s3-bucket your-bucket-name --aws-key YOUR_KEY --aws-secret YOUR_SECRET
```

## Configuration

All configuration is managed through a single `.env` file. An example with all available options is provided in `.env.example`.

**Key Configuration:**

- `BASE_DIR`: Specifies the root directory on the host machine where all persistent data (database, n8n data, backups, logs) will be stored. Defaults to `/opt/n8n-data` if not set.
- `DEPLOYMENT_TYPE`: Determines which services and features are enabled (e.g., `local`, `s3`, `traefik`, `production`).
- Other variables control database credentials, S3 details, Traefik settings, etc.

The setup script will automatically generate secure credentials and create the necessary configuration based on your selected deployment type.

### Manual Configuration

If you want to manually configure the deployment:

1. Copy the example environment file: `cp .env.example .env`
2. Edit the `.env` file, paying close attention to `BASE_DIR` and other settings relevant to your chosen `DEPLOYMENT_TYPE`.
3. Run the setup script with the `--no-interactive` flag: `sudo ./setup.sh --no-interactive`

## Backup and Restore

### Automatic Backups

When using the `s3` or `production` deployment types, the `backup-scheduler` service automatically runs daily (at midnight server time) using the script located at `./s3/backup-s3.sh`. Backups are uploaded to the configured S3 bucket.

- **Local Backups:** While the `backup-scheduler` primarily focuses on S3, temporary backup files might be created within your `${BASE_DIR}` during the process before being uploaded.
- **Retention:** Backup retention within S3 is typically managed by the `backup-s3.sh` script or S3 lifecycle policies (check the script for details).

### Manual Backup (S3/Production Profiles)

To trigger a manual backup when the `backup-scheduler` service is running:

```bash
# Execute the backup script inside the running container
sudo docker exec n8n-backup-scheduler sh -c "${BASE_DIR}/s3/backup-s3.sh"
```

*Note: Ensure the `BASE_DIR` variable is correctly set in your `.env` file, as it's passed into the container.*

### Restoring from Backup

Restoration typically involves retrieving the desired backup archive from S3 and using the `restore-s3.sh` script.

1.  **Download Backup:** Manually download the required backup archive (e.g., `n8n-backup-YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.tar.gz`) from your S3 bucket to your host machine.
2.  **Run Restore Script:** Execute the restore script, providing the path to the downloaded archive. You might need to run this within a temporary container that has access to Docker and the necessary tools (like `psql`, `tar`, `docker`).

```bash
# Example (conceptual - exact command might vary depending on restore script logic):
# You might need to adapt this or use a dedicated helper container
sudo docker run --rm -it --network n8n-network \
  -v $(pwd)/n8n-backup-YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.tar.gz:/tmp/backup.tar.gz \
  -v ${BASE_DIR}:${BASE_DIR} \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=${POSTGRES_USER} \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=${POSTGRES_PASSWORD} \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=${POSTGRES_DB} \
  --entrypoint sh \
  amazon/aws-cli:2.17.11 \
  ./s3/restore-s3.sh --backup-file /tmp/backup.tar.gz
```

*Consult the `./s3/restore-s3.sh` script for its specific usage and requirements.* The exact restore procedure depends heavily on the script's implementation.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **n8n fails to start**:

   - Check logs: `sudo docker logs n8n`
   - Verify PostgreSQL is running: `sudo docker ps | grep postgres`
   - Ensure environment variables are set correctly in `.env`, especially `BASE_DIR`.

2. **Backup fails**:

   - Check `backup-scheduler` logs: `sudo docker logs n8n-backup-scheduler`
   - Verify S3 credentials, bucket permissions, and region in `.env`.
   - Check available space within the `${BASE_DIR}` on the host if temporary files are large: `df -h ${BASE_DIR}`

3. **Traefik SSL certificate issues**:
   - Ensure your domain (`DOMAIN_NAME` in `.env`) points correctly to the server's public IP address.
   - Check Traefik logs: `sudo docker logs n8n-traefik`

For more detailed troubleshooting information, see the [Troubleshooting Guide](troubleshooting-guide.md).

### Logs

Check the following logs for troubleshooting:

- n8n logs: `sudo docker logs n8n`
- PostgreSQL logs: `sudo docker logs n8n-postgres`
- Qdrant logs: `sudo docker logs n8n-qdrant`
- Backup Scheduler logs: `sudo docker logs n8n-backup-scheduler` (includes cron output)
- Traefik logs: `sudo docker logs n8n-traefik`
- Deployment log: Check within `${BASE_DIR}/deployment.log` (if created by setup script)
- Backup log: Check within `${BASE_DIR}/backup.log` (created by backup script)

## Removing n8n

To remove n8n and all its components, you can use the interactive menu:

```bash
sudo ./utils/remove-n8n.sh
```

This will present you with a menu of options to selectively remove components.

For command-line removal with specific options:

```bash
# Remove everything (with confirmation prompts)
sudo ./utils/remove-n8n.sh --all

# Remove only containers
sudo ./utils/remove-n8n.sh --containers

# Remove containers and images
sudo ./utils/remove-n8n.sh --containers --images

# Force remove everything without confirmations
sudo ./utils/remove-n8n.sh --all --force
```

For more details on removal options, see the [Removal Guide](remove-n8n.md).
