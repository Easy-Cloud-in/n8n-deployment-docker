## Overview

This deployment solution offers:

- **Simple Setup**: A single script handles all deployment types
- **Multiple Options**: Support for local, S3 backup, HTTPS with Traefik, and Production-ready deployment
- **User-Friendly**: Interactive setup with clear prompts
- **Secure**: Automatic generation of strong credentials
- **Flexible**: Customizable through environment variables
- **Monitoring**: Optional Prometheus and Grafana integration for production deployments

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

1. **Docker**: Container management tool
2. **docker-compose**: Tool for defining and running multi-container applications with Docker

To install these prerequisites on most Linux distributions:

```bash
# Update your system
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade -y

# Install Docker
sudo apt-get install -y docker.io

# Install docker-compose
sudo apt-get install -y docker-compose
```

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/n8n-deployment-docker.git
cd n8n-deployment-docker
chmod +x setup.sh
```

### Step 2: Run the Setup Script

For interactive setup with prompts:

```bash
sudo ./setup.sh
```

This will guide you through the setup process with a user-friendly menu system.

## Deployment Options

### Local Deployment (Simplest)

This option runs n8n with local storage and backups:

```bash
sudo ./setup.sh --type local
```

### S3 Backup Deployment

This option adds automatic backups to Amazon S3:

```bash
sudo ./setup.sh --type s3 --s3-bucket your-bucket-name --aws-key YOUR_KEY --aws-secret YOUR_SECRET
```

### HTTPS with Traefik Deployment

This option adds HTTPS support with automatic SSL certificates:

```bash
sudo ./setup.sh --type traefik --domain n8n.yourdomain.com --email your@email.com
```

### Production Deployment (Recommended for Public Instances)

This option combines HTTPS support with S3 backups for a complete production-ready solution:

```bash
sudo ./setup.sh --type production --domain n8n.yourdomain.com --email your@email.com --s3-bucket your-bucket-name --aws-key YOUR_KEY --aws-secret YOUR_SECRET
```

## Configuration

All configuration is managed through a single `.env` file. An example with all available options is provided in `.env.example`.

The setup script will automatically generate secure credentials and create the necessary configuration based on your selected deployment type.

### Manual Configuration

If you want to manually configure the deployment:

1. Copy the example environment file: `cp .env.example .env`
2. Edit the `.env` file to set your desired configuration
3. Run the setup script with the `--no-interactive` flag: `sudo ./setup.sh --no-interactive`

## Backup and Restore

### Automatic Backups

Backups are automatically configured based on your deployment type:

- **Local Deployment**: Daily backups stored in `/opt/n8n-data/`
- **S3 Deployment**: Daily backups uploaded to your S3 bucket
- **Production Deployment**: Daily backups uploaded to your S3 bucket with HTTPS access

### Manual Backup

To trigger a manual backup:

```bash
# For local deployment
sudo /opt/n8n-data/backup.sh

# For S3 deployment
sudo /opt/n8n-data/backup-s3.sh
```

### Restoring from Backup

To restore from a backup:

```bash
# For local backup
sudo /opt/n8n-data/restore.sh --backup-id YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS

# For S3 backup
sudo /opt/n8n-data/restore-s3.sh --backup-id YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS
```

Replace `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS` with the timestamp of the backup you want to restore.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **n8n fails to start**:

   - Check logs: `sudo docker logs n8n`
   - Verify PostgreSQL is running: `sudo docker ps | grep postgres`
   - Ensure environment variables are set correctly in `.env`

2. **Backup fails**:

   - Check disk space: `df -h /opt/n8n-data`
   - For S3 backups, verify AWS credentials and bucket permissions

3. **Traefik SSL certificate issues**:
   - Ensure your domain points to the server's IP
   - Check Traefik logs: `sudo docker logs n8n-traefik`

For more detailed troubleshooting information, see the [Troubleshooting Guide](troubleshooting-guide.md).

### Logs

Check the following logs for troubleshooting:

- n8n logs: `sudo docker logs n8n`
- PostgreSQL logs: `sudo docker logs n8n-postgres`
- Traefik logs: `sudo docker logs n8n-traefik`
- Deployment log: `/opt/n8n-data/deployment.log`
- Backup log: `/opt/n8n-data/backup.log`

## Removing n8n

To remove n8n and all its components, you can use the interactive menu:

```bash
sudo ./utils/remove-n8n.sh
```

This will present you with a menu of options to selectively remove components.

For command-line removal with specific options:

```bash
# Remove everything (with confirmation prompts)
sudo ./utils/remove-n8n.sh --all

# Remove only containers
sudo ./utils/remove-n8n.sh --containers

# Remove containers and images
sudo ./utils/remove-n8n.sh --containers --images

# Force remove everything without confirmations
sudo ./utils/remove-n8n.sh --all --force
```

For more details on removal options, see the [Removal Guide](remove-n8n.md).

## Development

### Pre-commit Hooks

This repository uses pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality and consistency. The hooks perform the following checks:

- **Shell Scripts**: Lints shell scripts using shellcheck (if installed)
- **Markdown Files**: Validates markdown files using markdownlint
- **YAML Files**: Formats YAML files using prettier
- **JSON Files**: Formats JSON files using prettier
- **Commit Messages**: Validates commit messages using commitlint

#### Setup for Development

If you're contributing to this project, make sure you have the pre-commit hooks installed:

1. Ensure you have Node.js and pnpm installed
2. The hooks are automatically installed when you clone the repository and run `pnpm install`

```bash
# Install dependencies (including dev dependencies)
pnpm install
```

#### Commit Message Convention

This project follows the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification. Your commit messages should be structured as follows:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Examples:

- `feat: add S3 backup rotation feature`
- `fix: correct environment variable handling in setup script`
- `docs: update deployment instructions`
- `chore: update dependencies`

#### Manual Linting

You can manually run the linters with:

```bash
# Lint markdown files
pnpm run lint:md

# Lint shell scripts (requires shellcheck)
